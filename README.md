# TheElectrician
TheElectrician is a Valheim mod that adds electricity and automation to the game. 
By playing with this mod, you will automate many not very interesting processes and also increase their efficiency.

Many of the ideas are taken from Minecraft modifications such as Industrial craft. 
However, I will try to stick to the style of the original game and not turn it into something unrecognizable.

### Take a look at [wiki](https://github.com/FroggerHH/TheElectrician/wiki).
